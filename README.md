# moviesAnalysis

The goal of this exercise is to develop a model that predicts a movie's popularity, using available categorical and numerical features.

The main obstacles encountered are the following:

1) The dataset requires a lot of cleaning and feature engineering in order to be usable; 
2) A huge part (~75%) of the entire dataset have two important variables missing and because of that, it needs to be deleted; 
3) There is a need to introduce a regression imputation for two different variables before developing a final model.

In this exercise, the Movies Dataset available on Kaggle is used. For more information, please see below:
